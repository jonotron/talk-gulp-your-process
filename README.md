Gulp your process
=================

This is the slide deck for a short 20 min talk I gave at [kamloops.js](http://github.com/kamloopsjs).
It is geared at an audience new to node and/or gulp.

We briefly discuss node streams and go through a few basic gulp examples (
minifying CSS, uglifying javascript).
